# Work Log

Keep this lightweight: what changed, why, and what to do next.

## 2026-01-13
- Added `.agent/` + `prompts/` to persist agreements across machines.
- Collapsed context/workflow into `.prompts/INIT.md` (monolith); removed the separate context file.
- Added marker-based persistence flow: `PREMISE:` (proposal) vs `EXPLICIT:` (must persist).
- Next: paste any lost chat agreements you remember into `.agent/DECISIONS.md`.
